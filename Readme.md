# Neuroscience Reading Notes
# Author: Robert T. Lange

This repository contains simple reading notes, thoughts, questions and summaries of the papers/book chapters, which I ([Robert T. Lange](www.rob-lange.com)) during my Neuroscience time in Berlin.

The documents are grouped by overarching topic. First of all I hope that this way I am able to structure my knowledge gains and have a quick read to remind myself of keypoints. Second, I hope that you are able to follow my current interests and research progress.

**Notes:**

1. If there is a tick in the box, there exists a summary markdown file in the subdirectory. Otherwise, I have only read the document. Furthermore, I list below the chapters of books, while the markdown file contains the summary for the full (or the parts that I have worked in) book.
2. Most notes focus on the neuroscience. Notes on Machine Learning and method papers are kept in a separate repository.
