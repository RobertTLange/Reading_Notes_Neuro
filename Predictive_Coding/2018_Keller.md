# Title: Predictive Processing: A canonical cortical computation
# Authors: Keller and Mrsic-Flogel (2018)

### Main Takeaway: Review article on PC and generalization to processing - motivated by story of capability to distinguish between self-gen and external sensory input (in/voluntary eye movement scene stabilization/absence of movement perception).

# General Notes:
* Hypothesis: Trafo of efference copy (corollary charge) of motor command into sensory coord system - cancellation of reafferent sensory feedback
* Helmholtz - hypothesis of internal model of sensory consequences - sense of innervation
* Sherrington - muscular sense (proprioception) = view of nervous system built upon sensory-driven receptive fields - feature detectors - feedforward view
* PC based on comparison of sensory input with internal generative model of env
    * Experimental problem: poor access(control) to internal model/predictions from top-down

* Two classes of neurons: representation and prediction-error
    * sensory cortex - expected to be stimulus feature selective
    * sufficiently large basal firing rate for bi-dir signaling - need enough decrease/increase variability for signaling
        * less plausible in layer 2/3 of neocortex where baseline is too low
        * More plausible that computation is done by two separate PE neurons (positive-bottom-up + excitatory/negative-top-down + inhibitory)

* Updating of internal representations
    * representation = feature detectors + bottom-up drive
    * predictive = comparison bottom-up in and top-down predictions
    * Modification even in absence of bottom-up input

* Coordinate Systems: Trafo to each other via internal model (motor -> sensory - forward, sensory -> motor - inverse)
    * visual: gabor fitlers
    * auditory: spectro-temporal filters
    * motor: motor commands
    * infero-temporal: objects/concepts

* Cortex as a whole - likely non-hierarchically organized
* Heeger (2017) - model of PC with reversal of info flow

* T-D pred that functions to inhibit B-U input results in response decrease when stim become predictable and violation of strong prediction triggers response increase

* Circuits Perspective: 1. Comparator (deeper layers?), 2. Internal representation maintenance, 3. Gating signal setting precision

* Experimental ideas: Locomotion as proxy for visual prediction
    * plausible that long-range connections encode predictions  - Larkum 2013

* Experience dependence/conditioning - circuit mechanism: assemblies, thalamo-cortical loops, dynamic attractors

* Precision - study via dysfunctions
    * modulated via NMDA receptors - shizophrenia and autism spectrum - same circuit imbalance
    * decouple internal representation from stimulus - run model as simulation

* Why did neocortex develop? Hypothesis: enables behavioral alternatives!
