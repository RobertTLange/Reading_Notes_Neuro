# Title: Neuronal Population Coding of Movement Direction
# Authors: Georgopoulos et al (1986)

### Main Takeaway: Neuronal ensemble/population of motor cortex neurons encode for direction of movement. View neuron as vectors encoding preferred direction in space. Weighted summing yields direction congruent with actual movement direction.

# General Notes:

* Rhesus monkeys - studied 282 neurons (total?) - selected by activity change in spontaneous movements of arm

* Methods:
    1. Analysis of variance - filter direction sensitive Neurons - discarded ca 15 percent
    2. Fit multivar regression - filter direction tuned neurons
    * Explanation of frequency of discharge for every single neuron based on movement in specific direction (m). - transformed coefficients correspond to cell's preferred direction vector

* Broad tuning = cells change activity with movements in any direction. sharply tuned neurons on the other hand would only change with one or two directions

* Population vector can also be used to measure planning

# Questions:
* Somewhat agrees with Gallego et al 2018? - single neuron already encodes broad direction tuning that is then linearly aggregated.
