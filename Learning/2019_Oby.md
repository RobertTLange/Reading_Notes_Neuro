# Title: New neural activity patterns emerge with long-term learning
# Authors: Oby et al (2019)

### Main Takeaway:

# General Notes:

* Establish eveidence for causal link between changes in brain and new behavioral abilities/learning
    * Show that new neural activity patterns cause new behavior
    * Activity pattern defined by joint firing rate of a population of neurons measured during a brief time window
    * Use BCI learning paradigm - monkey has to move cursor  - Direct link from neurons to behavior

* Dimensionality reduction with factor analysis - PCA with each neuron having separate noise
    * Intrinsic manifold: span of factor matrix - linear loading - characteristic  pattern of activity

* BCI mapping with Kalman Filter - spikes to factors  to velocities
    * Training of monkey sequentially with increasing control over cursor

* Outside Manifold permutation: from spikes to factors - permutation! (non-orthogonal)
    * Requires multiple days - one day not enough!

* Within Manifold permutaion: from factors to velocities - different  decision boundary

* Learning defined by performance - "Progress to target" - but non-greedy learning!

* Problem of few-shot learning of sequences of skills. Not only single transfer but multiple

1. Encourage new pattern formation - BCI permutation

2. Detection of new patterns - Outside repertoire - speed limit

3. Show that new patterns are cause of behavior - new patterns correlate with improvement

* Not due to correlation structure in multi-day learning!

* How fast can  the monkey revert back to previous pattern.

* Learning fast and learning slow
